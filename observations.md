#### MAX OPEN INSTANCES
- When only limiting how many instances one proposer can open based on the number they have opened and closed themselves, there is a tennancy for prposers to fall out of sync and some to run on ahead
- Is there any scope to set total number of instances open separate from each server's? Does this help fall-behind? Does it limit total performance?

#### Incorrect handling of acceptance
- Config-ballots equal to the current promised configuration ballot were ignored
